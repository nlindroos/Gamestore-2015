New games are added to the inventory by giving a link to an URL of the game, which is an HTML file that should be displayed in an iframe to the player. The platform must support a simple message system, the games will send message events to the parent document informing on the score of the game. The platform should have a global high score for each game, where top scores for each game is displayed. </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c12"><span>Similarly to submitting high scores, the service should accept save/load game state messages. The save message can contain arbitrary JSON formatted data containing a state of a game and save it to the database. Similarly, if there is a saved game state for that game and that particular player, the service should send a message to the game, so the state can be loaded and the player can continue playing from their previous state.</span></p><h4 class="c12 c22"><a name="h.4nz7dfxe2nsa"></a><span>Sample Messages/Document the protocol</span></h4><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c12"><span>Game and the game service communicate with window.postMessage.
