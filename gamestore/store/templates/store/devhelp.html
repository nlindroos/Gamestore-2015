    <h1>Submitting games</h1>
    <p>
        On the 'My games' page you can upload a new game to the service, allowing players
        to purchase and play your game. Games are simply web pages that are placed in an iframe 
        and communicate with the service using window.postMessage. Therefore, you should host
        the game at another location, and just provide a link to the Gamestore2015 service. 
        The following sections explain how to submit your game, and describe the postMessage
        protocol that your game should implement in order to be compatible with the service. 
    </p>
    <h2>Filling out the form</h2>
    <p>
        In order to submit a game you must go to 'My games' and click 'Add new game'. You will 
        be presented with a form for uploading a new game. The form contains six input fields that
        should be filled out:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Title:</strong> the name of your game</li>
        <li><strong>URL:</strong> the URL to your game</li>
        <li><strong>Price:</strong> the price of your game, in Euros, limited to 999.99â‚¬</li>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> a brief description of your game</li>
        <li><strong>Image URL:</strong> a link to a picture that will be associated with your game (optional)</li>
        <li><strong>Tags:</strong> a list of tags that can be used to find the game in searches</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Adding tags</h3>
    <p>
        Probably the most important way to let players discover your game is to use the tagging system.
        Tags are single words that may contain letters, numbers and underscores only.
        Tags enable players to search for your game using keywords, and are used to match your game with other similar games.
        When adding tags, consider adding short and common keywords that people are likely to use (e.g. 'action' or 'strategy'), rather
        than complex tags that are hard for players to guess (e.g. 'turn_based_farming_simulation').
    </p>
    <p>
        To add a new tag, click the 'Add tag' button below the list of tags (typing a comma (,) after an existing tag
        will also add a new tag field). To reomve a tag, click the 'Remove' button next to the tag you wish to remove.
    </p>
    <h2>Game requirements</h2>
    <p>
        Your game can be basically anything, as long as it has a URL that we can use to link to it.
        The only restriction is that the game should follow your postMessage protocol for sending highscores
        and saving/loading games. Note also that the 'Play game' page contains nothing but an iframe holding your game,
        so you should provide all the necessary controls (e.g. save and load buttons) in your game.
    </p>
    <h3>The postMessage protocol</h3>
    <p>
        All messages sent between the game and the service should be Javascript objects containing at least a string
        called 'messageType' and possibly other attributes depending on the type of message (see below).
    </p>
    <p>The game must <strong>listen</strong> to the following types of messages:</p>
    <pre>
{
    messageType : "LOAD",
    gameState : {} // some object containing game state information
}</pre>
    <pre>
{
    messageType : "MESSAGE",
    message: "" // some string containing a message from the server to the game
}</pre>
    <p>
        The game must be able to <strong>send</strong> the following types of messages:
    </p>
    <pre>
{
    messageType : "LOAD_REQUEST"
}</pre>
    <pre>
{
    messageType : "SAVE",
    gameState : {} // some object containing game state information
}</pre>
    <pre>
{
    messageType : "SCORE",
    score : 0.0 // some number representing the player's score
}</pre>
    <p>Remarks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Game state must be a JSON serializable object</li>
        <li>
            Messages are sent from the service to the game in indication of 
            save/load success and failure, and highscore results (whether the score semt was a new highscore or not).
            Your game should make these messages visible to the player.
        </li>
        <li>
            Load requests are sent from the game when the user wishes to load a saved game. If loading is successful,
            the service will send a LOAD message, which your game should use to restore the game's state to the 
            one contained in the LOAD message.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Making your game visible</h2>
    <p>
        Players can find your games in one of three ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Searching on the 'All games' page</li>
        <li>Discovering similar games at another game's page</li>
        <li>Discovering other games by the same developer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In order to maximize the chances of your games being discovered and purchased you should:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide an extensive list of tags</li>
        <li>Use an easily searchable title</li>
        <li>Provide an accuarate and sufficiently detailed, yet exciting description of your game</li>
        <li>Provide a good picture for your game</li>
        <li>Set a reasonable price</li>
        <li>
            Before submitting a priced game, submit and interesting free game, to build up 
            your reputation as a good developer and to serve as a gateway for players to find your other games
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        By following these guidelines you will be likely to improve your popularity and sales. Note that
        Gamestore2015 gives no guarantee about what your sales will be. If you experience poor results, you may try changing
        the price of your game, or even remove the game from the service alltogether.
    </p>
